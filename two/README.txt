In this program, I used two methods to edit the alphabetcountmulthreads.c file. The first method was the thread method where I initialized the
data that needed to be accessed. Also in this method, I got the correct file processes and printed the correct process that is being executed.
I then created a while loop that checks for uppercase letters and switches it back to lowercase. Finally at the end of this method, I printed
that the thread id is done.

The other method I used was the alphabetcountmulthreads method with the parameters given by the instructor. In this method, I opened the 
needed directory for formatting and intitializing num of threads. At the end of this method, I used a for loop that sets the correct thread
process and print the correct statement. I used two more for loops that joined the threads and the other copied the result from them. 
I then opened results for formatting and closed the directory.




The results:
