For this program I first got the files needed onto my desktop. I also created a new folder called programming under my edoras account.

For both alphabetcount.c and specialcharcount.c, I opened a dircetory and assigned current name to string file name. In the first while loop
I opened the file path for reading and then used a while loop to check for necessary values. At the end of both these codes, I used 
fprintf for formatted writing and closed the directory.

For the testspecialcharcount.c, I used a while loop that contained if statements to check all special characters. At the end of the loop, I 
re initialized to get the next character in the loop.

For the testalphabetcount.c, I used a while loop with if statements to check for alphabet letters. Checked for both uppercase and lowercase 
letters and reinitialized to get the next character. 


Tested code with commands from the program pdf.
